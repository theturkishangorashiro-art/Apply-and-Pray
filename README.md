# 🙏 Apply & Pray

> **The AI-powered LinkedIn job application bot for people who are tired of clicking "Easy Apply" like it is a part-time job.**

Applying to jobs is a full-time job. This bot works overtime.

---

## 💀 Why This Exists

At some point, humanity collectively agreed that job seekers should upload a resume, manually retype it, answer the same questions, write cover letters, and repeat until motivation reaches critically low battery mode.

Welcome to **Apply & Pray**.

> Apply. Pray. Repeat. Preferably with fewer clicks.

---

## 🚀 What This Bot Does

The bot can search LinkedIn jobs, read job descriptions, fill application forms, answer repetitive screening questions, upload resumes, generate AI-assisted content when configured, and track application history through a local dashboard.

---

## 📦 Requirements

- **Python 3.11.x**
- **Google Chrome** latest stable version
- **Windows 10/11** recommended
- Internet connection
- LinkedIn account
- Resume PDF

> Python 3.11 is recommended because Selenium and `undetected-chromedriver` are more stable there than on newer bleeding-edge Python versions.

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Install Python 3.11

Install Python 3.11 and enable **Add Python to PATH**.

Verify:

```powershell
py -3.11 --version
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Test\Documents\Apply-and-Pray
py -3.11 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Your Details

Edit these files:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `config/personals.py` | Personal details used in applications |
| `config/questions.py` | Common screening answers and resume path |
| `config/search.py` | Job filters and preferences |
| `config/secrets.py` | LinkedIn login and optional AI API key |
| `config/settings.py` | Bot behavior, stealth mode, delays, paths |

### 5. Add Your Resume

Place your resume where `default_resume_path` points in `config/questions.py`.

Default example:

```python
default_resume_path = "all resumes/default/resume.pdf"
```

---

## ▶️ Run the Bot

```powershell
python runAiBot.py
```

Before running, close all Chrome windows, keep fewer than 10 tabs open, and make sure Chrome is updated.

---

## 📊 Run the Dashboard

```powershell
python app.py
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:5000
```

---

## 🧯 Troubleshooting

### ChromeDriver Version Error

If you see `This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version X`, update Chrome from `chrome://settings/help`, close Chrome, and run again.

This build also detects your installed Chrome version and asks `undetected-chromedriver` for a matching driver.

### Chrome Profile Permission Error

This build uses a safer Windows profile path:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\ApplyAndPrayChromeProfile
```

No more fighting `C:\temp` like it owes you money.
